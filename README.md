# pandaparade
final project of python data science course 1
This was my final project to demonstrate numpy and panda proficiency.
The work is based off of a public dataset capture of European airbnb data.
Significant time was spent cleaning data. 
Then we investigated vectorization techniques to accelerate runtime. 
I intend to update this readme in the next few days once I am better rested and write my retro. 
Panda for life! Terence
